## Introduction
Are you a Workday Integration Developer struggling with creating XSLT files from reports? Do you spend hours starting the file, copying and pasting each tag from the report definition, and writing loops and functions to format dates? Say no more! We've got the solution for you!

Introducing the Workday XSLT Generator Chrome Extension - a powerful tool that simplifies the process of generating XSLT files from reports. This extension is a game-changer for Workday Integration Developers, as it eliminates the tedious and time-consuming process of creating XSLT files from scratch.

Installation is easy - simply download the extension from the Chrome Marketplace and pin it to your browser. Once installed, you're ready to go!

To use the extension, log in to your Workday tenant and open any report that is enabled as a Webservice. To open the report, type "rd: report name" in the search bar. Then, refresh the browser tab and launch the extension. Select one of the options (XML, TEXT, or FIXED-WIDTH) and click on the Generate XSLT button. Voila! The extension will generate the XSLT code, which you can then copy to your clipboard and paste into a notepad. Save the file as .xslt, and you're done!

It's important to note that the tool only works on the report definition page and that the report must be open in read-only mode. Also, for optimal performance, we recommend using Google Chrome.

Why is this tool not available out-of-the-box? Well, we can only assume that the Workday developers have a lot on their plate!

In conclusion, the Workday XSLT Generator Chrome Extension is a must-have tool for all Workday Integration Developers. It saves time and effort, making XSLT generation a breeze. Don't waste any more time creating XSLT files from scratch - download the extension today!
